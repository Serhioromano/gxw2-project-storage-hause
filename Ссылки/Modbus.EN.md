# Modbus RTU Driver Library for Coolmay FX3G PLC

## Terminology

- **Register** — A contiguous region of memory within the Modbus address space.

---

## Prerequisites

The following libraries must be installed in the project prior to using this driver:

- `UtilsV4.sul`
- `TimeControlV2.sul`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The TimeControl V2 library must be installed and the `TCO_TICKER_50` ticker must be configured. This ticker advances at **50 ms** intervals and is required by the `MB_PROCESS_50` function block.
> - This library is compatible with **GX Works 2 v1.91** and later. Updates are available from the `coolmay/soft` directory.

## Changelog

### V1.5 — 9 April 2025

- **Added:** `xWriteOnce` property for channels.

### V1.4 — 9 April 2025

- **Added:** Automatic clearing of all registers allocated for data storage prior to the first read cycle.
- **Added:** `xDone` property for channels. Emits a pulse upon completion of one read/write cycle.

### V1.3 — 28 February 2025

- **Fixed:** Bug in which the connection was not restored after a timeout. (Reported by Alex_315.)

### V1.2 — 12 December 2024

- **Changed:** The `iReg` property of a channel now accepts `Word[Unsigned]` / `Bit String[16-bit]` types, enabling register addresses greater than 32,000.
- **Added:** Port constants `MB_PORT_2`, `MB_PORT_3`, `MB_PORT_CAN`, and `MB_PORT_TCP` for the `iPort` channel property.

### V1.1 — 29 September 2024

- **Changed:** Device area for data storage switched from `R` to `D` registers, because certain HMI panels (e.g., the OP320 series) do not expose `R` registers over the Modbus protocol.

### V1.0 — 22 September 2024

- Initial release.

## Architectural Description

This library enables a Coolmay FX3G PLC to operate as a **Modbus Slave** or a **Modbus Master** (on the secondary and tertiary RS485 ports — ports 2 and 3, respectively) for reading from and writing to Modbus RTU devices. It provides a low-overhead interface for configuring and managing Modbus communication channels.

Coolmay PLC/HMI integrated units are equipped with two RS485 ports: port 2 is exposed on the terminal connector, and port 3 is exposed on the DB9 connector. L02-series PLCs also provide two RS485 ports, both on terminal connectors.

---

## `MB_PORT_SETTINGS` (Function)

Returns a correctly formatted bit-field value for initialising a port as either Master or Slave.

| Variable   | Scope  | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Parity`   | INPUT  | `Word[Signed]`         | One of: `MB_PARITY_NONE`, `MB_PARITY_ODD`, `MB_PARITY_EVEN`.                                                                  |
| `StopBit`  | INPUT  | `Word[Signed]`         | One of: `MB_STOPBIT_1`, `MB_STOPBIT_2`.                                                                                       |
| `Baudrate` | INPUT  | `Word[Signed]`         | One of: `MB_BPS_600`, `MB_BPS_1200`, `MB_BPS_2400`, `MB_BPS_4800`, `MB_BPS_9600`, `MB_BPS_19200`, `MB_BPS_38400`, `MB_BPS_57600`, `MB_BPS_115200`. |

Declare a local variable of type `Double Word [Unsigned]` (e.g., `PortSettings`), then invoke the function:

```iecst
PortSettings := MB_PORT_SETTINGS(MB_PARITY_NONE, MB_STOPBIT_1, MB_BPS_9600);
```

---

## Modbus Slave

### `MB_SLAVE_INIT_PORT2`, `MB_SLAVE_INIT_PORT3`

These functions initialise the Modbus slave on port 2 or port 3 of the PLC, respectively.

| Variable       | Scope  | Type                    | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `xInit`        | INPUT  | `Bit`                   | Initialisation command. The slave is (re-)initialised on every rising edge.              |
| `iAddress`     | INPUT  | `Word[Signed]`          | Modbus network address assigned to this PLC.                                              |
| `PortSettings` | INPUT  | `Double Word[Signed]`   | Return value of the `MB_PORT_SETTINGS` function.                                          |

#### Example

The following snippet configures a slave with address 1 on port 2:

```iecst
PortSettings := MB_PORT_SETTINGS(MB_PARITY_NONE, MB_STOPBIT_1, MB_BPS_9600);
M0 := MB_SLAVE_INIT_PORT2(TRUE, 1, PortSettings);
```

No further configuration is necessary for the PLC to function as a slave on port 2. The same pattern applies to port 3. The variable `M0` is not referenced elsewhere in the program — it exists solely to satisfy the syntactic requirement that a function call used as a statement must have a left-hand side assignment.

---

## Modbus Master

### `MB_MASTER_INIT_PORT2`, `MB_MASTER_INIT_PORT3`

These functions initialise the Modbus Master on port 2 (terminal connector) or port 3 (DB9 connector), respectively.

| Variable       | Scope  | Type                    | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `xInit`        | INPUT  | `Bit`                   | Initialisation command. The master is (re-)initialised on every rising edge.             |
| `PortSettings` | INPUT  | `Double Word[Signed]`   | Return value of the `MB_PORT_SETTINGS` function.                                          |

#### Example

```iecst
PortSettings := MB_PORT_SETTINGS(MB_PARITY_NONE, MB_STOPBIT_1, MB_BPS_9600);
M0 := MB_MASTER_INIT_PORT2(TRUE, PortSettings);
```

### `MB_PROCESS_50` (Function Block)

This function block orchestrates all read and write operations across the configured channels.

> **Prerequisite:** The TimeControl V5.0 library must be installed and `TCO_TICKER_50` must be configured. This ticker advances at 50 ms intervals and drives the internal scheduling of channel operations.

| Variable       | Scope  | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mb_xEnable`   | INPUT  | `Bit`           | Enables channel processing.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `mb_iBuffer`   | INPUT  | `Word[Signed]`  | Base device number for the buffer area. For register channels, `D{mb_iBuffer}` is used as the first buffer device; for coil channels, `M{mb_iBuffer}` is used. The buffer consumes as many devices as the `iNum` value of the largest channel. |
| `mb_Timeout`   | OUTPUT | `Word[Signed]`  | Device address of the channel that timed out.                                                                                                                                                 |

#### The `MB_REG_50` Structure

A global array `MB_CHANNELS` of 30 elements of type `MB_REG_50` is declared internally by the library. No user declaration is required. This array defines the set of channels to be processed. Each channel may read or write up to 125 registers. The array must be configured once, typically on PLC startup under the `M8002` initialisation pulse flag.

The following table lists the fields of the `MB_REG_50` structure:

| Variable          | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `tCycle`          | `Word[Signed]`                       | Cycle interval for automatic reads/writes, in units of 50 ms. E.g., `20` = 1 second. Set to `0` for manual-only operation via `xReadOnce` / `xWriteOnce`.                  |
| `iWR`             | `Word[Signed]`                       | Read/write mode. Default: `MB_READ_WRITE`. May be set to `MB_READ` or `MB_WRITE`.                                                                                          |
| `iPort`           | `Word[Signed]`                       | Communication port identifier. See § Supported Ports.                                                                                                                       |

#### `iDDevNum` — Buffer Allocation

Each channel reserves **twice** the number of devices specified by `iNum`. Half of the allocation holds the actual register or coil values; the other half is used internally for change tracking.

If `iNum = 1` and `iDDevNum = 200`:
- `D200` stores the value.
- `D201` is reserved for internal use.

If `iNum = 5`:
- `D200`–`D204` store the values.
- `D205`–`D209` are reserved for internal use.

> **Caution:** Failure to account for the internal buffer when assigning `iDDevNum` values across consecutive channels will result in data corruption.

Consider the following **incorrect** configuration:

```iecst
MB_CHANNELS[0].iDDevNum := 600;
MB_CHANNELS[0].iNum := 3;

MB_CHANNELS[1].iDDevNum := 603;
MB_CHANNELS[1].iNum := 1;
```

Channel 0 consumes devices `D600` through `D605` (3 values + 3 internal). The first free device is therefore `D606` — not `D603`. Assigning `iDDevNum := 603` to channel 1 causes its buffer to overlap with the internal area of channel 0, producing undefined behaviour.

The **correct** allocation is:

```iecst
MB_CHANNELS[0].iDDevNum := 600;
MB_CHANNELS[0].iNum := 3;

MB_CHANNELS[1].iDDevNum := 606;
MB_CHANNELS[1].iNum := 1;
```

---

#### `iWF` — Write Function Selection

Two write-function codes are available for registers:

- **`H6` (Write Single Register):** When assigned to a multi-register channel, only the register whose value changed is written in a dedicated request.
- **`H10` (Write Multiple Registers):** When assigned to a multi-register channel, a change to any register within the group triggers a single request that updates the entire group.

**Guidance:**
- For double-word values spanning multiple registers → use `H10`.
- For multiple independent single-register variables on the same channel → use `H6`.
- For a single-register channel → use `H6`.

The same principle applies to coil channels: use `H5` (Write Single Coil), even when the channel spans multiple coils.

    END_IF;
END_IF;
```

**Post-configuration behaviour:**
- `D600`, `D601`, and `D602` hold the three register values read from device address 1, refreshed every second. If any value changes locally, the slave is updated immediately (`xWriteOnChange := TRUE`).
- `D610` holds the single register value read from device address 16. Since this channel is configured as read-only (`MB_READ`), any local modification to `D610` will be overwritten by the next read cycle (every 200 ms).

---

### Alternative Write Confirmation

The expression `IF D10 = D13 AND D11 = D14 AND D12 = D15 THEN` implements a buffer-comparison strategy for verifying write completion.

As described in § `iDDevNum`, each channel reserves twice the number of devices specified by `iNum`. With `iDDevNum := 10` and `iNum := 3`:

- `D10`–`D12` hold the actual register values.
- `D13`–`D15` serve as the change-tracking buffer.

Upon a successful write, the library updates the buffer to match the newly written values. Therefore, equality between the value registers and their corresponding buffer registers confirms that the write has completed.

This technique is particularly useful when employing `xWriteOnChange` (rather than `xWriteOnce`) with a multi-register channel and write function `H6`. If, for example, two registers within a ten-register channel are modified, `H6` writes each one individually, setting `xDone` once per successful write. Counting two distinct `xDone` pulses can rapidly become unwieldy. In contrast, a single comparison of the form `IF D10 = D13 AND D11 = D14 AND …` confirms that all changed registers have been successfully propagated to the slave in a single check.

## Timeout and Suspension Mechanism

The library implements a channel-suspension policy for fault tolerance. If a channel fails to receive a response for `MB_TIMEOUT_COUNT` consecutive attempts, it is flagged as **suspended**. Once suspended, the channel is polled at a reduced rate — once every `MB_SUSPEND_RETRY` interval. As soon as a valid response is received, the suspension flag is cleared and the channel resumes its normal cycle interval as defined by `MB_CHANNELS[*].tCycle`.
